# FIVE Steps for Turning Problems into Code #

**1. Understanding the Problem**

- Once you have the answer to your questions, try writing out a problem statement that explains exactly what you're building.

- If the problem is big and complex, break down the large program into the smaller features that are easier to manage. And most complex applications out there are composed of many smaller programs working together.

**2. Discovering Inputs, Processes, and Outputs**

- If you have a clear problem statement, you can look at the nouns and verbs in the statement. The nouns end up becoming your inputs and outputs, and the verbs will be your processes. Of course, the problem statement won't always be clear. But as you gain more experience, you'll be able to fill in the gaps and read between the lines.

**3. Driving Design with Tests**

- Many professional software developers do this using a formal process called test-driven development, or TDD. TDD does require some knowledge about the language you're using and a little more experience that the beginning developer has out the of gate.

- The essence of TDD is to think about what the expected result of the program is ahead of time and then work toward getting there. And if you do that before you write code, it'll make you think beyond what the initial requirements say.

- If you're not quite comfortable doing formal TDD, you can still get many of the benefits by c-reating simple test plans. A test plan lists the program's inputs and its expected results.

**4. Writing the Algorithm in Pseudocode**

- An algorithm is a step-by-step set of operations that need to be performed.

- Pseudocode is an English-like syntax that lets you think about the logic without having to worry about programming language syntax.

- Pseudocode isn't just for beginners; experienced programmers will occasionally write some pseudocode on a whiteboard when working with teammates to solve problems, or even by themselves.

- There's no "right way" to write pseudocode, although there are some widely used terms. You might use *Initialize* to state that you're setting an initial value, *Prompt* to say that you're prompting for input, and *Display* to indicate what you're displaying on the screen.

- Best of all, we can use pseudocode as a blueprint to code this up in any programming language.

**5. Writing the Code**

- Once you write your initial version of the program and get it working, you can start tweaking your code to improve it.
